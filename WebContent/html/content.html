  		<h1>About Partner</h1>
  		<p>Partner Software began as a group within Exploration Resources, a computing and environmental services company. Partner spun off in January 1997 to commercialize map viewing technology originally developed for environmental monitoring studies. GreyStone Power Corporation, a Georgia electric power distribution cooperative, served as our co-developer and first customer. GreyStone provided the product concept, field engineering expertise, usability requirements and expert testing that made the first program, "Staking Partner", a success.
		The initial field tool expanded into an enterprise-class product with interfaces to a variety of other systems. The system also grew to address work flow and other issues; then the map viewer evolved into a platform for map-based applications of all kinds.
		There are now more than 190 utilities using our software. These utilities provide power to more than 4.9 million consumers.</p>
